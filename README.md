Heart Rate Monitor: E155 Final Project
==================
This Microprocessor-Based Systems (E155) final project is by Kaitlin Kimberling and Kristina Ming for Fall 2014.

The system uses an infrared LED and a photodiode to measure a user's pulse. A PIC32 microcontroller is used as an analog-to-digital converter and an Altera Cyclone III FPGA is used for digital filtering of the pulse signal. The PIC and FPGA communicate over SPI.
